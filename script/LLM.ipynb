    "Rules:\n",
    "  • Use American English spelling, following the AP Stylebook and Merriam-Webster Dictionary as the reference.\n",

    "      – Remove size indicators (e.g., \"small\", \"XL\"), quantity counts (e.g., \"3 pcs\"), and side items.\n",
    "      – If the base is unclear or ambiguous, use \"unknown\".\n",
    "      – Use singular form (e.g., \"sandwich\" not \"sandwiches\").\n",
    "      - You need to use menu_name and elaborate the context from restaurant_name, restaurant_type, menu_item_description\n",
    "\n",
    "  • dish_flavor:\n",
    "      – Each tag must be no more than two words.\n",
    "      – Avoid duplicating the dish_base unless it adds meaning.\n",
    "      – Use singular form (e.g., \"egg\" not \"eggs\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  • is_combo:\n",
    "      – Set to `true` if the item clearly bundles multiple components (e.g., main dish + sides + drink).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "  • A raw JSON array only—no additional text or formatting.\n",
