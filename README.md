# üçΩÔ∏è Heymate Menu Recommendation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a menu recommendation pipeline for Heymate's restaurant partners. By analyzing internal product, store, and category data‚Äîalong with external datasets‚Äîwe seek to provide insights into menu item popularity, pricing, and restaurant-specific recommendations. Our recommendations help partners optimize their offerings through data-driven insights.

## Summary
We conduct comprehensive data validation, enrichment, and exploratory analysis on restaurant menu data. Key steps include:

- Cleaning inconsistent menu item names using LLMs  
- Merging external datasets (e.g., DoltHub, Kaggle)  
- Scoring menu item popularity  
- Building a pipeline to deliver actionable insights to restaurant clients
